# Deposit Plan Allocator (Go)

This project simulates how deposits are allocated into different investment portfolios based on a customerâ€™s one-time and/or monthly deposit plans â€” similar to how StashAway works.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

A customer can:
- Create **one-time** and/or **monthly** deposit plans
- Make deposits via bank transfer (which are not linked directly to any plan)

### Goal:
Fully allocate all deposited funds across portfolios based on active plans.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- âœ… Handles one-time and monthly deposit plans
- âœ… Distributes deposits proportionally if funds are insufficient
- âœ… Written in **Go**, using integer cents for precise calculations
- âœ… Fully tested with edge cases

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go               # CLI entry point (package main)
â”œâ”€â”€ deposit/              # Core logic (package deposit)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deposit.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deposit_test.go
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â””â”€â”€ go.sum
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the CLI example:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Run the tests:

```bash
go test ./deposit
```

## ðŸ§ª Example

Given:
- One-time plan: 
  - High risk: $10,000
  - Retirement: $500
- Monthly plan:
  - Retirement: $100

Deposits:
- $10,500
- $100

**Output:**
```
Final allocations:
High risk: $10000.00
Retirement: $600.00
```
